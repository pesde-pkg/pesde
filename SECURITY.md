# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As pesde is currently in version 0.x, we can only guarantee security for:

- **The latest minor** (currently 0.7).
- **The latest release candidate for the next version**, if available.

When a new minor version is released, the previous version will immediately lose security support.

> **Note:** This policy will change with the release of version 1.0, which will include an extended support period for versions >=1.0.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.7.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.7   | :x:                |
