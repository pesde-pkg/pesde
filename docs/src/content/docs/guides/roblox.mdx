pesde can be used in Roblox projects, however this requires some extra setup.
Namely, you need to specify a `roblox_sync_config_generator` script in order
to generate the adequate configuration for the sync tool you are using.

The [`pesde-scripts`](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-scripts)
repository contains a list of scripts for different sync tools. If the tool
you are using is not supported, you can write your own script and submit a PR
to get it added.

These scripts are automatically cloned into the `~/.pesde/scripts` folder and
kept up to date when you use pesde.

## Usage with Rojo

[Rojo](https://rojo.space/) is a popular tool for syncing files into Roblox
Studio.

Running `pesde init` will prompt you to select a target, select
`roblox` or `roblox_server` in this case. This will setup the configuration
needed to use pesde in a project using Rojo.

## Usage with other tools

If you are using a different sync tool, you should look for it's scripts in the
pesde-scripts repository. If you cannot find them, you can write your own and
optionally submit a PR to help others using the same tool as you get started
quicker.

Scaffold your project with `pesde init`, select the `roblox` or `roblox_server`
target, and then replace the `.pesde/roblox_sync_config_generator.luau` script
with the one you want to use.

## Authoring packages

When authoring packages for Roblox, it is recommended to have your code inside
of a `src` directory (or any other directory you prefer).

Inside of your `pesde.toml` you must specify the `roblox` environment and the
`lib` field with the path to your main script. You must also specify a list of
`build_files`. This list should contain names of top level files or directories
that should be synced into Roblox by a sync tool, such as Rojo.

Let's say you have a package with the following structure:

<FileTree>

- roblox_packages/
  - dependency.luau
  - ...
- src/
  - init.luau
  - foo.luau
  - bar.luau
  - ...
- LICENSE
- pesde.toml
- README.md
- selene.toml
- stylua.toml

</FileTree>

There are lots of files in the root directory that are not needed in Roblox,
such as configuration files, READMEs, and licenses. We only want the `src` and
the `roblox_packages` directory to be synced into Roblox.

<FileTree>

- roblox_packages/
  - dependency (roblox_packages/dependency.luau)
  - ...
- src/ (src/init.luau)
  - foo (src/foo.luau)
  - bar (src/bar.luau)
  - ...

</FileTree>

This is where `build_files` come in, we can specify a list of files that should
be synced into Roblox. In this case, we only want the `src` directory to be
synced. We do not need to specify the `roblox_packages` directory, as it is
always synced.

So for our package, the `pesde.toml` file would roughly look like this:

```toml title="pesde.toml" {15}
name = "acme/package"
version = "1.0.0"
license = "MIT"

includes = [
  "pesde.toml",
  "LICENSE",
  "README.md",
  "src",
]

[target]
environment = "roblox"
lib = "src/init.luau"
build_files = ["src"]

[dependencies]
dependency = "acme/library"
```

When a consumer of your package installs it, the `roblox_sync_config_generator`
script they are using will generate the configuration needed for their sync
tool. For example, a Rojo user would get a `default.project.json` with the
following contents:

```json title="default.project.json"
{
	"tree": {
		"src": {
			"$path": "src"
		},
		"roblox_packages": {
			"$path": "roblox_packages"
		}
	}
}
```

The linker scripts that pesde generates will then point to the `src` module.

Then, to publish your package, you can follow the steps in the
["Publishing Packages"](/guides/publishing/) guide.

### Test place with Rojo

You might want to create a "test place" where you can test your package inside
Roblox, or to get proper LSP support when developing your package.

To do this, you can create a `test-place.project.json` file which includes your
package and the `roblox_packages` directory.

```json title="test-place.project.json"
{
	"tree": {
		"$className": "DataModel",
		"ReplicatedStorage": {
			"package": {
				"$className": "Folder",
				"src": {
					"$path": "src"
				},
				"roblox_packages": {
					"$path": "roblox_packages"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

You can then run `rojo serve` with this project file:

```sh
rojo serve test-place.project.json
```

If you are using [Luau LSP](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp) you can
change the `luau-lsp.sourcemap.rojoProjectFile` extension setting to
`test-place.project.json` to get proper LSP support when developing your
package.

### Differences from Wally

Those coming from [Wally](https://wally.run/) may be a bit confused by the
way pesde handles Roblox packages.

In Wally, it is standard to have a `default.project.json` with the following:

```json
{
	"tree": {
		"$path": "src"
	}
}
```

This will cause the `src` directory to be directly synced into Roblox.

In pesde, you should not have a `default.project.json` file in your package.
Instead, you are required to use the `build_files` field to specify a 1:1 match
between Roblox and the file system. pesde forbids `default.project.json` to be
part of a published package, and regenerates it when installing a pesde git
dependency. This allows the consumer of your package to choose the sync tool
they want to use, instead of being constrained to only using Rojo.

This has the effect that the structure of the files in the file system ends up
being reflected inside Roblox.

With Wally, the structure that ends up in Roblox ends up looking like this:

<FileTree>

- Packages/
  - \_Index/
    - acme_package@1.0.0/
      - package/ (src/init.luau)
        - foo (src/foo.luau)
        - bar (src/bar.luau)
        - ...
      - dependency

</FileTree>

Whereas with pesde, it looks like this:

<FileTree>

- roblox_packages/
  - .pesde/
    - acme+package/
      - 1.0.0/
        - src/ (src/init.luau)
          - foo (src/foo.luau)
          - bar (src/bar.luau)
          - ...
        - roblox_packages/
          - dependency (roblox_packages/dependency.luau)

</FileTree>
