## Configuration

Before you can publish a package, you must configure the required fields in your
`pesde.toml` file.

### `includes`

The `includes` field is a list of globs that should be included in the package.

```toml
includes = [
  "pesde.toml",
  "README.md",
  "LICENSE",
  "src/**/*.luau",
]
```

### `target`

The `target` field defines the environment where the package can be run.

Here, you must also specify the `lib` and/or `bin` fields to indicate the path
of the exported library or binary.

```toml
[target]
environment = "luau"
lib = "init.luau"
```

#### Roblox

`bin` is not supported in Roblox packages.

## Authentication

Before you can publish a package, you must authenticate with your GitHub
account.

```sh
pesde auth login
```

You will be given a code and prompted to open the GitHub authentication page in
your browser. You must enter the code to authenticate.

## Publishing

To publish a package, run the following command:

```sh
pesde publish
```

You will be prompted to confirm the package details before publishing.

Once a package is published, others will be able to install it. You may not
remove a package once it has been published. You may not publish a package with
an already existing version.

## Multi-target Packages

You may publish packages under the same name and version but with different
targets. This allows you to publish a package that can be used in multiple
environments.

For example, you may publish a package that can be used in both Roblox and
Luau environments by publishing two versions of the package, one for each
environment.

<Aside type="caution">

Packages for different targets but on the same version must have
the same description.

## Documentation

The `README.md` file in the root of the package will be displayed on the
[pesde registry website](https://pesde.daimond113.com/).

You can include a `docs` directory in the package containing markdown files
and they will be available on the pesde registry website. You can see an example
in [`pesde/hello`](https://pesde.daimond113.com/packages/pesde/hello/latest/any/docs).

### Customizing the sidebar

You can include frontmatter with a `sidebar_position` to customize the order
of the pages on the sidebar.

```md title="docs/getting-started.md"
---
sidebar_position: 2
---

# Getting Started

Lorem ipsum odor amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Eleifend consectetur id
consequat conubia fames curae?
```

You can have directories in the `docs` directory to create nested pages. These
will show up as collapsible sections in the sidebar. You can include a
`_category_.json` file inside the nested directories to customize the label and
the ordering in the sidebar.

```json title="docs/guides/_category_.json"
{
	"label": "Guides",
	"position": 3
}
```

<Aside type="tip">

Make sure to include `docs` inside the `includes` field in `pesde.toml`
otherwise they won't be published with your package.
