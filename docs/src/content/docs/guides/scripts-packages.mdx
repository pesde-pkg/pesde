<Aside type="caution">
    While scripts packages currently exist, it is intended that their functionality will be removed
	before pesde 1.0 in favour of binaries. 
    
    Take this into consideration when creating a scripts
	package.

</Aside>

A **scripts package** is a package that contains scripts. The scripts provided
by the package are linked in `.pesde/{alias}/{script_name}.luau` of the project
that uses the package.

## Using a scripts package

Scripts packages can be installed using the `pesde add` and `pesde install`
commands.

This requires a `pesde.toml` file to be present in the current directory, and
will add the scripts package to the `dependencies` section of the file.

```sh
pesde add pesde/scripts_rojo
pesde install
```

This will add the scripts package to your project, and installing will put the
scripts at `.pesde/scripts_rojo/{script_name}.luau`. You can then add the scripts
to your manifest, for example:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[scripts]
roblox_sync_config_generator = ".pesde/scripts_rojo/roblox_sync_config_generator.luau"
```

## Making a scripts package

To make a scripts package you must use a target compatible with scripts exports.
These currently are `lune` and `luau`.

Here is an example of a scripts package:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
name = "pesde/scripts_rojo"
version = "1.0.0"
license = "MIT"

[target]
environment = "lune"

[target.scripts]
roblox_sync_config_generator = "roblox_sync_config_generator.luau"
```

The `scripts` table in the target is a map of script names to the path of the
script in the package. The scripts will be linked in the project that uses the
package at `.pesde/{alias}/{script_name}.luau`.
