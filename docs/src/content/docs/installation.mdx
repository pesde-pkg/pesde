<Steps>

1. Go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/pesde-pkg/pesde/releases/latest).

2. Download the corresponding archive for your operating system.

3. Extract the downloaded archive to a folder on your computer.

4. Open a terminal and locate the path of the extracted `pesde` binary.

      <TabItem label="Windows">

      If you extracted the archive to `C:\Users\User\Downloads`, the path to the
      `pesde` binary would be `C:\Users\User\Downloads\pesde.exe`.

      You can then run the `self-install` command:

      ```ps
      C:\Users\User\Downloads\pesde.exe self-install
      ```

      pesde should now be installed on your system. You may need to restart your
      computer for the changes to take effect.

      <Aside type="caution">
      pesde uses symlinks which are an administrator-level operation on Windows.
      To ensure proper functionality, enable [Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development).
      
      
      If you are getting errors such as `Failed to symlink file, a required
      privilege is not held by the client`, then enabling this setting will fix
      them.

      If you extracted the archive to `~/Downloads`, the path to the `pesde`
      binary would be `~/Downloads/pesde`.

      You must then add execute permissions and run the `self-install` command:

      ```sh
      chmod +x ~/Downloads/pesde
      ~/Downloads/pesde self-install
      ```

      pesde should now be installed on your system. You will need to update your
      shell configuration file to add the pesde binary to your `PATH`
      environment variable.

      ```sh title=".zshrc"
      export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.pesde/bin"
      ```

      You should then be able to run `pesde` after restarting your shell.

  5. Verify that pesde is installed by running the following command:

      ```sh
      pesde -v
      ```

      This command should output the version of pesde that you installed.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">

It is not recommended to use toolchain managers (such as Rokit or Aftman) to
install pesde. You can use `pesde self-upgrade` if you need to update pesde.

If you need everyone to use the same version of pesde, you can use the
`pesde_version` field in `pesde.toml` to specify the version of pesde to use
for the current project.
